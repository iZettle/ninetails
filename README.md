Ninetails is a simple CMS API engine. It is designed on the idea of a CMS which is limited in scope in that not all aspects of a page should be editable. Instead, you can define Sections, Elements, and Properties which are editable and can then be loaded in and styled in a reliable manner. It gives you the control to decide exactly what should and what should not be editable in your project.

## Getting started

Ninetails is a mountable Rails engine, so it needs to be loaded into your app. You app is also where you will define your components which Ninetails should expose. Start by adding it to your Gemfile:

```
gem "ninetails"
```
