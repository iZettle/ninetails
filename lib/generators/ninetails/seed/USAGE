Description:
  Generates seed files to make it simpler to create Ninetails Pages and Layouts.

Example:
    rails generate ninetails:seed Page /gb/card-readers

  This will create:
    seeds/pages/gb/card-readers.rb

  Layouts can also be generated using:

    rails generate ninetails:seed Layout main_layout

  You can also pass an array of Sections which you want to include in the seed. For example, if you've defined Billboard and SellingPoints sections, you could run:

    rails generate ninetails:seed Page /gb/card-readers Billboard SellingPoints
